Code
=============================


To recreate the figures used in the manuscript run the workflow.R file contained within the NicheCompetition folder.

```r
	setwd("NicheCompetition")
	source("workflow.R")
```


The *in silico* dilution methods were run in R (version 3.3.1), using the package deSolve (version 1.13).
